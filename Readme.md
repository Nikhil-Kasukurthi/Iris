# Visitor Engagement 
While on a trip to the museum we observed that there are limited ways to explore further about a particular art piece. We alleviate this through a companion android application for the museum. If a visitor is interested in a particular exhibit, a simple scan on the name tag will present the user with a potential set of questions that could be asked about the exhibit generated from Wikipedia articles. If the user has a different question, the app can answer that as well. In addition to this using style transfer, the visitor can create a version of themselves into any of the paintings that are on exhibit at the museum.
